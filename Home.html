        	<h1>Welcome to SciSec 2024</h1>
          <p> The 6th International Conference on Science of Cyber Security (SciSec 2024) will be held 14-16 August, 2024 in Copenhagen, Danmark. The conference is organized by the Technical University of Denmark(DTU). This new forum was initiated in 2018 and aims to catalyze the research collaborations between the relevant communities and disciplines that can work together to deepen our understanding of, and build a firm foundation for, the emerging Science of Cyber Security. Publications in this venue would distinguish themselves from others by taking or thinking from a holistic perspective about cyber security, rather than a building-block perspective. Each submission will be reviewed by at least 3 reviewers. The program committee plans to select and award a Best Paper and a Best Student Paper. The post-conference proceedings will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series, indexed by EI and IIE-C.</p>
          <p>There will have a poster session. The submission should be no more than two pages. Accepted posters will not appear in the post-conference proceedings, but will be invited to submit full version papers to International Journal of Digital Crime and Forensics (IJDCF, indexed by ESCI and EI). At least one author of a poster must register to attend the conference.</p>
          <p>The conference solicits high-quality, original research papers that can justifiably help achieve the ultimate Science of Cyber Security. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: </p>
          <ul>
          	<li>Cybersecurity Dynamics
            <li>Cybersecurity Metrics and Their Measurements
<li>First-principle Cybersecurity Modeling and Analysis (e.g., Dynamical Systems, Control-Theoretic, and Game-Theoretic Modeling)

<li>Cybersecurity Data Analytics
<li>Quantitative Risk Management for Cybersecurity	
<li>Big Data for Cybersecurity
<li>Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity
<li>Machine Learning for Cybersecurity
<li>Economics Approaches for Cybersecurity
<li>Social Sciences Approaches for Cybersecurity
<li>Statistical Physics Approaches for Cybersecurity
<li>Complexity Sciences Approaches for Cybersecurity
<li>Experimental Cybersecurity
<li>Macroscopic Cybersecurity
<li>Statistics Approaches for Cybersecurity
<li>Human Factors for Cybersecurity
<li>Compositional Security
<li>Biology-inspired Approaches for Cybersecurity
<li>Synergetics Approaches for Cybersecurity
  <ul>
  <p>It is stressed that it is the authors’ responsibility to explicitly justify the relevance of a submission to cyber security and how a submission is contributing to the Science of Cyber Security.</p>
