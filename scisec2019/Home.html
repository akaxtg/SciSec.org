        	<h1>Welcome to SciSec 2019</h1>
          <p> The 2nd International Conference on Science of Cyber Security (SciSec’2019) will be held August 9-11, 2019 in Nanjing, China. The conference is organized by the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications. This new forum was initiated in 2018 and aims to catalyze the research collaborations between the relevant communities and disciplines that can work together to deepen our understanding of, and build a firm foundation for, the emerging Science of Cyber Security. Publications in this venue would distinguish themselves from others by taking or thinking from a holistic perspective about cyber security, rather than a building-block perspective. Each submission will be reviewed by at least 3 reviewers. The program committee plans to select and award a Best Paper. The post-conference proceedings will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series and indexed by EI Engineering Index. Selected papers from the ones published in the post-conference proceedings will be invited to submit to a <a href=" http://organ-assoc.business.utsa.edu/isfrontiers/forthcoming.html" target="_blank"><strong>special issue of the Information Systems Frontier journal</strong></a>, which requires substantial new materials and has its own review process. </p>
          <p>The conference solicits high-quality, original research papers that can justifiably help achieve the ultimate Science of Cyber Security. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: </p>
          <ul>
          	<li>Cybersecurity Dynamics
            <li>Cybersecurity Metrics and Their Measurements
<li>First-principle Cybersecurity Modeling and Analysis (e.g., Dynamical Systems, Control-Theoretic, and Game-Theoretic Modeling)

<li>Cybersecurity Data Analytics
