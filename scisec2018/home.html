        	<h1>Welcome to SciSec 2018</h1>
          <p> The 1st International Conference on Science of Cyber Security (SciSec 2018) will be held August 12-14, 2018 in Beijing, China. The conference is organized by the Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences. This new forum aims to catalyze the research collaborations between the relevant communities and disciplines that can work together to deepen our understanding of, and build a firm foundation for, the emerging Science of Cyber Security. Publications in this venue would distinguish themselves from others by taking or thinking from a holistic perspective about cyber security, rather than the building-block perspective. Each submission will be reviewed by at least 3 reviewers. The program committee plans to select and award a Best Paper. The post-conference proceedings will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.</p>
          <p>The conference solicits high-quality, original research papers that can justifiably help achieve the ultimate Science of Cyber Security. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: </p>
          <ul>
          	<li>Cybersecurity Dynamics
            <li>Cybersecurity Metrics and Their Measurements
<li>First-principle Cybersecurity Modeling and Analysis (e.g., Dynamical Systems, Control-Theoretic, and Game-Theoretic Modeling)

<li>Cybersecurity Data Analytics
<li>Big Data for Cybersecurity
<li>Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity
<li>Machine Learning for Cybersecurity
<li>Economics Approaches for Cybersecurity
