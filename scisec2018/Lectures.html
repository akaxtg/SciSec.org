      <td id="GT"><strong>Abstract: </strong>The rapid development of cyber technology represented by the Internet and Big data is now profoundly changing human society's each aspect. Cybersecurity is no exception when all fields of cyberspace are being redefined in this new wave. Based on the speaker’s almost 20-year experience in the field of information security, this presentation mainly introduces the security requirements form the Internet infrastructure to the Internet firm, discusses the changed and unchanged in cybersecurity and finally prospects the new trend of the future cybersecurity, from the perspective of the government, corporates and users.</td>

      <td id="MY"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Developing of Secure System has always been a hard problem and not so well understood.  In light of this I will review the notion of "Science of Security" and will try to challenge the goals, needs, and thus methodologies in the area. What is "Science" and how to approach it has always been an interesting and controversial issue (regardless of area of study), let alone an area like security that is in itself itself not so well defined and quite broad). I will touch upon what we can learn from the philosophy of science, and what can we learn from the goals of security in actual systems (will try to give an example about some discussion points I will make). Then will discuss issues and non-issues in this very young sub-area.</td>
