      <td id="MY_abs"><strong>Abstract: </strong>The goal of science of security is to understand better and contribute to the design and the effectiveness of actual secure systems.
In this talk I will raise a few basic issues:
	      
-To be successful, Sci Sec needs to cover deployment methodologies to understand the full life cycle of security systems and components;
	      
-The interaction with general engineering needs to be adapted to methodologies that assure success of security systems; and 
	      
-I will stress the notions of flexibility and proactive nature of deployment that assure extended role of a system
	      
I will use actual deployment of the ADX system for demonstrating my points.</td>

      <td id="MY_abs"><strong>Abstract: </strong> Conceptualized 12 years ago as a core component of Bitcoin, blockchain has gained a vast amount of interest. Informally speaking, a blockchain is a distributed, shared, and immutable ledger that maintains a growing list of ordered records. It became extremely popular among the industries in the last few years. Many companies are exploring applications of blockchain beyond cryptocurrencies. 

In this talk, the speaker will discuss the role of cryptography in blockchains, and how it contribute to the security and privacy of blockchain and its various applications. He will also highlight some of the latest development in this area. Topics covered include various cryptographic tools useful for security and privacy in blockchains, the need for appropriate security models, and statistical attacks on transaction privacy. Finally, we will conclude the talk with challenges related to the adoption of blockchain technologies and insights developed from our experience.

      <td id="MY_abs"><strong>Abstract: </strong> Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) is a secure tool that enables users to delegate keyword searches over encrypted databases to an honest but curious server, while preserving the privacy of the keywords and the encrypted documents. In this talk, we will begin by introducing the concepts, mechanisms, and security notions related to SSE. We will then discuss current attacks on SSE and highlight some of the open problems in this area. </td>
