      <td id="MY"><strong>BIO:</strong> Moti Yung is a Security and Privacy Scientist with Google, with main interests in Cryptography, Security, and Privacy. He graduated from Columbia University in 1988 and is an adjunct senior research faculty at Columbia till today. In parallel to Columbia he has had an industrial research career, working at places like IBM, RSA Labs. (EMC), Snap, and now Google. Yung is a fellow of ACM, of IEEE, of the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) and the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS). Among his awards are ACM's SIGSAC Outstanding Innovation Award in 2014, and 2018 IEEE Computer Society W. Wallace McDowell Award. His research covers broad areas: from the theory and foundations, to applied systems, and actual engineering efforts of cryptography, privacy, and secure systems.</td>

      <td id="MY_abs"><strong>Abstract: </strong> In this talk I will demonstrate that building on scientific techniques and methods based on systems' needs give solutions
which provide solutions of higher and better quality than otherwise. The goal of the talk is to encourage the interactions
between more theoretical work and practical needs. I will use actual industry projects to demonstrate the issue.</td>

      <td id="MY_abs"><strong>Abstract: </strong> The concept of zero knowledge proof provides a magic method of proving theorems in which the prover reveals nothing to the verifier but their validity. In this talk we will give a brief introduction of zero knowledge proofs, focusing on some key ideas behind its constructions, interplay with computational complexity, and powerful applications to cryptography and today's cryptocurrency.</td>
